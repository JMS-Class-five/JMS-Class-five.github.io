  <h1>Family Education</h1>
  <p><i>Here are some manners that children should e advised to use in public.</i></p>
  <p>First, say hello to people they know. They can also shake hands with
people if they meet for the first time.</br>
Second, use “indoor voices” indoors. They should keep quiet or keep
their voices down in the places like libraries, hospitals. Never shout or laugh
loudly in public.</br>
Also, never throw any rubbish on the ground. To keep the environment
clean, they shouldn't drop litter everywhere.</br>
And, if they bump into someone, they should always say,"Excuse me."
What's more, it's important that they learn to wait for their turn.</p>
